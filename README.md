# [VTuber Schedules](https://vtuberschedules.com/)

Website to view stream schedules of VTubers from several agencies.

## Usage

When filtering for a specific agency, you can see the currently live as well as upcoming streams
for those VTubers.

Click the top-left button to open the menu to show additional features:

- filtering by streamer
- jumping to a specific date
- quick links to filter by an agency
- whether to show past streams
- dark mode toggle

## ⚠️ Notice ⚠️

This application is more of a personal project for me, so don't expect frequent updates.

It's also not free to host and power this application so it can be torn down at any time.

## FAQ

Who are you?
> Just a fellow VTuber fan!

Why don't I see all the schedules?
> This app will only show whatever streams that they put up on YouTube. So for example if they have an upcoming stream 5 days from now but don't have the *waiting room* up on YouTube, then it won't show here.

Does this show members-only videos?
> No.

How accurate is this information?
> The information gets updated every 5 minutes.

Why do streams sometimes disappear?
> The source (YouTube) to get the stream information is not exactly stable. The stream should show up again on the next refresh interval / update.

Are the dates converted to my local timezone?
> Yes, there is a label in the menu to show the timezone they converted to.

Does this support Twitch streamers?
> Currently it does not, but I do have plans to look into it.

My oshi is not on here. Can I get them added?
> Yes! Please follow instructions [here](https://github.com/clovenski/vtuber-schedules/blob/main/assets/Onboarding.md) for more information. Note that there is a limit to how many VTubers that can be on here, so act fast!

Is there a way to show the schedule on my Google calendar?
> Not for every VTuber. For Nijisanji EN VTubers, see [here](https://github.com/clovenski/nijisanji-en-schedules/blob/main/assets/gcal/README.md) for more information. I don't plan on adding this feature for every VTuber on this site.

Will newly debuted VTubers be added here?
> Yes, if their agency is supported / listed on this site, then they will eventually get added once their channel gets created. If I miss it, don't hesitate to request for them to be added through [here](https://github.com/clovenski/vtuber-schedules/blob/main/assets/Onboarding.md).

Are you ever going to open-source this application?
> I can consider it if there's enough demand. I'd only open-source the front-end portion though.
