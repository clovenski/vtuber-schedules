There is currently no defined limit for the number of Twitch VTubers that can be supported.

## Prerequisites

The VTuber should be active (i.e. not retired, streams often, etc.).

Note that they **do not** need to be in an agency. There is a default group called `Independent`
where all the indie VTubers would be grouped.

## Instructions

1. Make sure the VTuber is not already on this website. Filter for their agency and the menu's filter feature shows all the supported VTubers underneath this agency.
2. Make sure no one else is requesting for the same VTuber to be added. Take a quick look in [here](https://github.com/clovenski/vtuber-schedules/issues).
3. Create an issue [here](https://github.com/clovenski/vtuber-schedules/issues) that details who you'd like to be added.
